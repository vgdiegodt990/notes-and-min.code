WWW/World Wide Web/"Web" - information system for sharing resources/documents through...
URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) - resources shared through Internet (global network) 
- Documents transfered via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - set of rules/protocols)

HTML - Hypertext Markup Language / changing the structure of text content (lists, links, bold/italics) 
HTML Elements - used to write HTML, structuring it - defined by HTML Tags ->    <p> ... </p>
        Use the elements for structuring, <h1> being top level or <div> for separation 

HTML Boilerplate/Skeleton - essentials needed for proper display/structure 
    Head stores metadata (title, favicon), body for text/content 

Anchor tag <a> for creating hypertexts, needs an attribute to pass info back to tag
    |-> remember to use correct protocol -> google.com = file protocol, https://www.google.com = https protocol

HTML defined as a set of instructions for how HTML works... reason why different browsers have 
different variations (add CSS difference) - rendering engine or rules
    Think of it as a STANDARD

<div> standas as the "content division" (always thought of it as "divider") 
- generic container that's a block level element
<span> another generic container BUT inline level element 

<hr> horizational rule      <br> break, line break
<sup> superscript, used for citations, above a charcater 
<sub> subscript, rendered below, used for chemicals or fractions

HTML Entities - characters that are specially reservered, used in place of difficult to type characters
    Starts w/ an ampersand (&) and ends in semicolon (;) - browsers interprets and renders 
Ex: Less than sign (<) can cause confusion for IDE b/c its a servered character in HTML, browser can show 
it's fine but issues may occur internally: use an entity -> &lt; 

Semanatic Markup (Semanatic Elements) - adding meaning to program/markup, makes it easier to know what's the 
purpose of element and also for accessibilty (screen reader)
_______________
|<th>|<th>|<th>| = <tr> Tables are structured sets of data made up of rows and columns - good for data display
|<th>|<td>|<td>| = <tr>     used early on (90's) for positioning content - deprecated use 
|<th>|<td>|<td>| = <tr> = table row, <th> = table head, <td> = table data 
---------------
    Semantic Markup for table: <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot> 
Use <colspan> & <rowspan> attribute to further breakdown one header sections 

<form> element is a shell or container w/ no visual impact, fill it w/ data and then it's
routed for other use - often inputs are made 
    action attribute specifies WHERE form data is sent 
    method attribute specifies WHICH HTTP method should be used 
Name attribute dictates what the data's "name" is when sent to the backend 
Value attribute functions similarly BUT value defines the input data while name defines the input field name 

Creating a button: <input type="submit> vs <button> elements - go w/ button instead b/c to chnage the text
                   w/ input is roundabout way + it makes distinction easier - semanatic markup

HTML Form Validation - setting parameters for the data that gets passed along the form 
                           e.g having special character for password or certain length
    Attributes: min-length, max-length, required (essential for making them work), pattern

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets, language for how documents are visually presented - arranged and styled 
CSS Rules - what you do in CSS will, for the most part, follow this pattern:
    selector { property: value; }       ex: h1 { color: purple; }

Ways for Including Styles
1. Inline Styles - writing the style directly inline on each element - cringe 
2. <Style> Element - placed in the <head>, easy but makes it impossible to share styles between documents 
3. External Stylesheet - writing styles in a .css file, then include it using <link> element in 
                         the <head>, best way for separation and sharing 

CSS Color Systems
RGB (Red, Green Blue) - uses the three "channels" for mixture, each range from 0-255 
rgb (255, 0, 0) [Red], rgb (173, 20, 219) [Purple type], rgb (0, 0, 0) [Black]

Hex(adecimal) - still red, green, blue channels BUT represented w/ hexadecimal base 16 instead, 
                16 choices - go from 0-9 and then A-F = 16 total / leads to more compact color names/references 
#ffff00 - first 2 digits = red, middle 2 = green, last 2 = blue 

hsl (hue, saturation, lightness) - more difficult to conceptualize, charts to the left - 0% lightness = black,
saturation w/ how "purpe" the color is - dull or not - if you go over 360 then it will still work, 
will just use the remainder - ex: 200 and 560 = same color (hue)
        Conceputalize a circle, 0 = red, 60 = yellow, 120 = green, 180 = cyan, blue = 240, 300 = magneta 
        Then goes around and cycles through again

Additive - hsla, the fourth parameter muse be between 0.0 and 1 - determines transparency
           - 'a' in hsla no longer required, can just put the value in hsl 
- can be done w/ rgb too, no added 'a'
- in hex the last two digits add the alpha channel, ex: #6ace8800 [00 is full transparency]
- 'a' = alpha channel 
* opacity property changes the whole selector, so yes there is a difference between it and alpha channel
